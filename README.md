A Rust port of Apache Lucene - the full-text search library.

## Status

Bearing is in **alpha**. The API will change.

- **Indexing**: Multi-threaded `IndexWriter` with fourteen field types, five doc values types, term vectors, and sparse fields
- **Querying**: TermQuery and BooleanQuery (MUST, SHOULD, MUST_NOT, and mixed) with BM25 scoring
- **Codec**: Lucene103 — indexes are readable by Java Lucene and vice versa
- **Correctness**: Query results are cross-validated against Java Lucene across multiple corpus sizes

## API Documentation

Full API documentation is available on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/bearing/).

## About

Bearing is a port of [Apache Lucene 10.3.2](https://lucene.apache.org/) to Rust. It writes and reads Lucene-compatible indexes using the Lucene103 codec, producing byte-identical results to the Java implementation.

This project exists at the intersection of learning and building. It's an exercise in learning Rust and exploring AI-assisted development with Claude Code, while producing something that might actually be useful. The code is AI-generated and a work in progress — it won't be perfect, and it moves at its own pace. This is a personal project: no pull requests, no issue tracker, no collaborators. If it interests you, fork it and make it your own.

## Quick Start

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bearing = "0.1.0-alpha.4"
```

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use bearing::prelude::{
    DocumentBuilder, FSDirectory, IndexWriter, IndexWriterConfig,
    SharedDirectory, keyword, text,
};

let fs_dir = FSDirectory::open(std::path::Path::new("/tmp/my-index")).unwrap();
let directory = Arc::new(SharedDirectory::new(Box::new(fs_dir)));
let writer = IndexWriter::new(IndexWriterConfig::default(), directory);

let doc = DocumentBuilder::new()
    .add_field(text("body").value("the quick brown fox"))
    .add_field(keyword("category").value("animals"))
    .build();
writer.add_document(doc).unwrap();

writer.commit().unwrap();
```

See the [`prelude`](https://docs.rs/bearing/latest/bearing/prelude/) module for all available field types.

## Why "Bearing"?

The name is a play on words. A bearing gives direction — fitting for a search library. Bearings also carry load — as this project aims to do for indexing workloads. And of course, bearings are made of steel, which isn't too far from Rust.
